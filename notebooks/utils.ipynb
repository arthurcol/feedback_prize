In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action.

I personally do not use my cell phone when I drive, because it distracts me very easily. <strong> [Evidence] </strong></Evidence> <Claim style='padding: 2px'> I suggest that drivers should be able to use their cell phone for an emergency purpose only. Even in a crisis situation, the driver should pull over to the side of the road before making a call.  <strong> [Claim] </strong></Claim> <Claim style='padding: 2px'>I also encourage that the cell phone companies should be made to have the cell phone come from the factory to where if your cellphone is moving, it will not be allowed to ring or give you any notifications.  <strong> [Claim] </strong></Claim> <Evidence style='padding: 2px'>In order to get your notifications, you will have to manually tell your cellphone to read that you are not driving for it to allow you to open the phone. It will then give you the notifications and or missed calls you have missed.
